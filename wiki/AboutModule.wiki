#About modules (device driver)

In a C program, use '#include </sys/modctl.h>'
and call 'modctl()'. See modulec.c for more details

status:
Installed: driver is in somewhere like /kernel/drv/...
Loaded: driver is in memory, with configuration?

= Details =
_how to help recognize device driver and device instance?_
*TODO: TEST*
add_drv : load_drv() config_drv()
rem_drv -c : unload unloaddrvconf
update_drv : just reload drvconf...
